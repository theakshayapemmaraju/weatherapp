## :scroll: Description
This weather app is pet-themed! The user can always choose the appâ€™s theme to be a dog version or a cat version, depending on what they prefer. Along with the cutest animated pet of your choice, you can also find out the latest news. There is a slider provided for you to change the time of weather you want to know. 


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
As a pet-lover and a new app developer, I thought it would be fun to combine both and make an app with a pet theme! I've had this idea for a while and this seemed like the perfect opportunity as I also got to learn about Jetpack Compose. Since everyone has their own preference, I made the app customisable, so that the user can choose their weather app's theme pet (cat/ dog) and they can always switch to the other one if they change their mind.
